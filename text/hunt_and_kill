The Hunt-and-Kill algorithm begins by selecting a random starting cell and creating a random walk:
 - From the current cell, it repeatedly moves to a random unvisited neighbor, removing the wall between them.
 - This continues until the walk reaches a cell with no unvisited neighbors.
At that point, the algorithm switches to the hunt phase.
It scans the grid from the top-left corner, searching for the first unvisited cell that has at least one visited neighbor.
When such a cell is found, it is connected to a visited neighbor, and the random walk continues from there.
These two phases (random walk and hunting) repeat until all cells in the grid have been visited, producing a complete maze.
