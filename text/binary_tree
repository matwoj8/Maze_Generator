The Binary Tree algorithm generates a maze by visiting each cell in the grid exactly once.
For every cell, the algorithm considers its two possible neighbors: the one to the right and the one below:
 - If both neighbors exist, it randomly chooses one of them and removes the wall between the two cells.
 - If only one neighbor is available, it removes the wall in that direction.
 - If no neighbors exist (bottom-right corner), nothing happens.
Repeating this process for all cells produces a simple, perfect maze with a characteristic diagonal bias.
